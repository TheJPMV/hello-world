# hello-world

Hello there, how you doing?

I'm JP, a computer science student from Brazil. I'm interested on learning about many programing lenguages, as C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, mobile-development for Android, and web-development with HTML5 and CSS3. And, last but not least, I love video games, and my aspiration is to be a game-developer, in an ideal future!
